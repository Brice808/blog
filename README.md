This is my first personel project : a photo blog with laravel 8.

I am still working on it so it will get more and more updates depending of my free time and new ideas. 

If you point out some bugs feel free to tell me !

If you want to launch it:

Run composer install

Copy .env.example on the root folder and rename it .env

Open your .env file and change the DB_DATABASE to the one you have already created

Enter your credentials in DB_USERNAME and DB_PASSWORD

Run php artisan key:generate

Run npm install && npm run dev

Run php artisan migrate

Run php artisan serve

Open your localhost (localhost:8000 by default)
